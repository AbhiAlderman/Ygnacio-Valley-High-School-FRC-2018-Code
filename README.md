# Ygnacio-Valley-High-School-FRC-2018-Code
This code functions the same as the program that ran Ygnacio Valley High School FRC Team 7137's robot in 2018. 
The program that ran the robot in 2018 was made using Labview. I created this project in 2019 to teach myself Java for the upcoming season.

---CONTENT---

OI.java - Create the controllers, buttons, and assign commands to buttons.

Robot.java - Runs through the states of the game, executing code throughout.

RobotMap.java - Creates the motors and drivetrian

Main.java - Not created or edited by me. Given and used by FRC when creating a robotics project.

The folders are organized as follows:

SUBSYSTEMS - All files within the subsystems are classes that create the different subsystems available on the robot. Subsystems create multiple methods that are then used by Commands.

COMMANDS - Commands simply execute methods that were created in the subystem when an assigned button is pressed.

---BACKGROUND---

This was my first ever programming project, and my first original Java program. 

This project was created during my Junior year of high school in the months before the new competitive season.

This robot won us the Rookie All Star Award at our local competition, allowing us to compete in the international championship in Houston, Texas.

Here is an instagram post of the robot: https://www.instagram.com/p/BoA32Vyle2_/

---FIRST ROBOTICS COMPETITION(FRC)---

The FIRST Robotics competition is a competition in which high school teams across the globe compete by building a robot in 6 weeks to perform in each years game. The students design, build, and program their own robots as a team, and compete against other high schools in their region. The top teams from each region compete at the international finals held in Houston, Texas.
